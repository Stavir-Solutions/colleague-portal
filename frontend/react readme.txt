Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine

Open your terminal (command prompt) and run the following command to install Create React App globally:
npm install -g create-react-app
This installs Create React App globally on your machine, allowing you to use it to create new React applications.



Create a New React App:
Once Create React App is installed, you can create a new React application by running the following command:
npx create-react-app my-react-app

Replace "my-react-app" with the desired name of your React application. 
This command will create a new folder with the specified name and set up a basic React project structure inside it.

Move into the newly created project directory:
cd my-react-app

Start the development server and open the React application in your default web 
npm start
